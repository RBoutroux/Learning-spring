# Learning-spring

Here is a summary of the main actions we used for the project :  

Create a Web Application (with Maven) in Netbeans  
Check project properties, add Spring Web library  
Create project infrastructure (controller, items, repository)  
Add database connection and create entities  
Create repositories main infrastructure (Repository, CurstomRepository, CustomRepositoryImpl)  
Update applicationContext.xml and servlet-dispatcher.  
copy bootstrap, js, img, css directories to Webapp  
Add Controllers  
Check pom.xml (ensure library compatibility). Suggestion : keep a valid pom.xml file somewhere.  
Create views and controllers each time you need one. Add methods to repositories when you need it.  
keep somewhere an AJAX view to be able to reply to AJAX calls  


Main things to take care of :  
• JDK and Tomcat 9  
• Ensure compatibility between JDK version and Spring libraries versions  
• Valid pom.xml  
• ApplicationContext.xml and DispatcherServlet.xml
