What is JSTL?
JSP files can include a language to manipulate data : JSTL (or Java server page Standard Tag Library).
Car permet par exemple de créer des boucles dans le fichier jsp. (et à pue près toutes les fonctions logiques)


How do you send data to a view?
You use a ModelAndView inside a controller : 
	ModelAndView returned;
	returned = new ModelAndView("books");
	Collection<Book> myList = bookRepository.findAll();
	returned.addObject("booksList", myList);
	return returned;


In a controller, how do you get informations from a form?
You use a servlet request : 
	public ModelAndView handleReturn(HttpServletRequest request){
		String borrowStr = request.getParameter("id");
        	int borrowId = getIntFromString(borrowStr);


How do you associate a route to a controller?
You use this annotation : 
	@RequestMapping(value = "createbook.do", method = RequestMethod.POST)


How do you define a class as a Controller? a Repository?
You use annotations : 
	@Controller
	public class BorrowController {
	
	@Repository
	public interface BookRepository extends JpaRepository<Book, Integer>, BookRepositoryCustom{


What is the difference between SQL and JPQL?
In Java EE, the Java Persistence API (JPA) is the standard API for accessing relational databases, providing a simple and efficient way for managing the object/relational mapping (ORM) of regular Java objects (POJO) to relational data. Such Java objects are called JPA entities or just entities.
The main difference between JPQL and SQL lies in that the former deals with JPA entities, while the latter deals directly with relational data. 



What is @Autowired used for?
The annotations (especially “Autowired”) can tell to Spring and JPA to use default implementations
for our interfaces.
It is used to be able to easily instantiate a repository.
