WEB-INF : Configuration directory for the application.
It contains :
– some configuration files.
* web.xml that defines servlet, listeners, the starting page, …
* applicationContext.xml that defines how the application works, how to find
controllers and repositories
* dispatcher-servlet.xml that defines how to find controllers, repositories and views.
* beans.xml that define the list of controllers in some spring versions
– html, jsp files : used when you start the application

web.xml tells many things about the way the application works.
• “contextConfigLocation” : where is the file applicationContext.
• the servlet “dispatcher” (the servlet-name sets the name) : tells which module manages the
servlets.
• the tag “servlet-mapping” for “dispatcher” : explains that the routes that ends with “.do” are
sent to the dispatcher to be managed by the servlet.
• the tag “welcome-file-list” : tells which file is the starting page.
